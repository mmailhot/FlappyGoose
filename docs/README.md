Flappy Goose in GBA.js
=====================

Based on [GBA.js](https://github.com/endrift/gbajs).

This includes a copy of the Flappy Goose ROM, which may or may not be up to date, sorry. If you
want to use your own build, you must run gbafix.exe on the output of the Makefile to fix the header,
since GBA.js is pickier about it that most emulators.
