Flappy Goose for GBA in Rust
============================

A rust game for the GBA. Based on the previous work of exoticorn on [gba-rust](https://github.com/exoticorn/gba-rust)

To build, you need to install nightly rust + sources (probably using rustup.rs)
as well as [xargo](https://github.com/japaric/xargo).

You also need arm-none-eabi binutils in your path. On linux you can
probably install those through your package manager.
